# üèõ Community DAO Governance Contract  

## Overview  
This **Community DAO Governance Contract** enables decentralized, token-based decision-making for a community. It allows participants to create, vote on, and finalize proposals using governance tokens. The contract ensures fair voting, prevents duplicate votes, and maintains proposal integrity.  

## Features  
- **Governance Token**: Used as voting power within the DAO.  
- **Proposal Creation**: Community members can submit proposals if they meet token requirements.  
- **Voting Mechanism**: Members vote based on token balance, ensuring fair representation.  
- **Finalization of Proposals**: Once the voting period ends, proposals are marked as **PASSED** or **FAILED** based on token-weighted votes.  
- **Transparency & Security**: Prevents multiple voting, enforces voting periods, and ensures proposals meet a minimum threshold to pass.  

## Contract Details  

### üìå Constants  
| Constant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CONTRACT-OWNER` | The deployer of the contract, responsible for initializing governance tokens. |
| `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED` | Error returned when a user lacks required permissions. |
| `ERR-PROPOSAL-NOT-FOUND` | Error returned when a proposal does not exist. |
| `ERR-ALREADY-VOTED` | Error returned if a user attempts to vote twice on the same proposal. |
| `ERR-VOTING-ENDED` | Error returned if voting has already ended for a proposal. |
| `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-TOKENS` | Error when a user lacks tokens required to create a proposal. |
| `ERR-PROPOSAL-FAILED` | Error returned when a proposal does not meet the required vote percentage. |

### üîó Data Structures  

#### **Governance Token**  
- `governance-token`: A fungible token representing voting power, initially minted to the contract owner.  

#### **Proposals (`proposals` map)**  
Each proposal is stored with the following attributes:  
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `proposal-id` | `uint` | Unique identifier for the proposal. |
| `proposer` | `principal` | The creator of the proposal. |
| `description` | `string-utf8` | Detailed description of the proposal. |
| `vote-start` | `uint` | Block height when voting starts. |
| `vote-end` | `uint` | Block height when voting ends. |
| `proposed-changes` | `string-utf8` | Summary of proposed changes. |
| `total-votes-for` | `uint` | Number of votes in favor. |
| `total-votes-against` | `uint` | Number of votes against. |
| `status` | `string-ascii` | Status of the proposal (`ACTIVE`, `PASSED`, `FAILED`). |
| `vote-threshold` | `uint` | Minimum percentage required for the proposal to pass. |

#### **Voter Tracking (`voter-votes` map)**  
Tracks whether a user has voted on a proposal.

## üõ† Functions  

### üîπ **Public Functions**  

#### **Mint Governance Tokens**  
```clojure
(define-public (mint-governance-tokens (recipient principal) (amount uint))
```
**Purpose**: Mints governance tokens for a user, granting them voting power.  
**Access**: Only callable by the contract.  

#### **Create Proposal**  
```clojure
(define-public (create-proposal (description (string-utf8 500)) (proposed-changes (string-utf8 200)) (vote-duration uint))
```
**Purpose**: Allows community members to create a proposal if they hold at least **100 governance tokens**.  
**Parameters**:  
- `description`: Proposal details.  
- `proposed-changes`: Summary of suggested modifications.  
- `vote-duration`: Duration (in blocks) for which voting is open.  
**Returns**: The `proposal-id` of the newly created proposal.  

#### **Vote on Proposal**  
```clojure
(define-public (vote-on-proposal (proposal-id uint) (vote-for bool))
```
**Purpose**: Allows users to vote on proposals. Voting power is determined by token balance.  
**Checks**:  
‚úÖ Proposal must exist.  
‚úÖ Voting period must be active.  
‚úÖ User must not have voted already.  
‚úÖ User‚Äôs vote weight is based on token balance.  

#### **Finalize Proposal**  
```clojure
(define-public (finalize-proposal (proposal-id uint))
```
**Purpose**: Concludes voting and determines whether a proposal is **PASSED** or **FAILED**.  
**Logic**:  
- If **YES votes** exceed the vote threshold, the proposal **passes**.  
- Otherwise, the proposal **fails**.  

#### **Initialize Governance**  
```clojure
(define-public (initialize-governance)
```
**Purpose**: Mints initial governance tokens to the contract owner.  
**Access**: Executed upon contract deployment.  

---

### üîπ **Read-Only Functions**  

#### **Get Proposal Details**  
```clojure
(define-read-only (get-proposal-details (proposal-id uint))
```
**Purpose**: Fetches details of a given proposal.  

#### **Check Voting Power**  
```clojure
(define-read-only (get-voting-power (account principal))
```
**Purpose**: Returns the governance token balance of an account, representing voting power.

## üîê Security & Governance Mechanisms  

### ‚úÖ **Voting Power Based on Token Holdings**  
- Users with more governance tokens have more influence.  
- Token-based voting ensures fair distribution of decision-making power.  

### üö´ **Prevention of Double Voting**  
- The contract maintains a record of voters to prevent multiple votes.  

### ‚è≥ **Time-Limited Voting**  
- Each proposal has a fixed duration for voting, ensuring timely decisions.  

### üìú **Threshold for Proposal Approval**  
- A **50% vote threshold** is required for proposals to pass.  

---

## üîó Deployment & Usage  

### üöÄ **Deployment**  
1. Deploy the contract on **Stacks blockchain**.  
2. Call `initialize-governance` to mint initial governance tokens.  

### üèó **Usage**  
1. Users receive governance tokens.  
2. Users create proposals with a valid description and voting duration.  
3. Community members vote using governance tokens.  
4. Once voting ends, the proposal is finalized.  
5. Approved proposals are executed; failed ones are archived.

## üì¢ Conclusion  
The **Community DAO Governance Contract** is a **decentralized, transparent, and token-based** governance system that empowers communities to make collective decisions efficiently. üöÄ
